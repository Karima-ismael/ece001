		<p>The advancement of artificial intelligence can also be seen in medicine. From prevention and examination to diagnosis, treatment and disease management, innovative companies and technology-oriented medical institutions have developed, tested and implemented increasingly smart algorithms in almost every branch of medical care. At the same time, organizers are turning their attention to the topic. In February 2019, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) released a discussion paper on licensing AI applications for medicine. It is not about "simple" apps that have been trained and retrained during updates - these solutions do exist and have regulatory approval. Instead, the new FDA initiative relates to more sophisticated AI systems that learn in real-time and constantly change algorithms, requiring that they be organized differently from traditional software solutions. </p>

			<p>In laboratory work, there is interest in algorithms that support operational processes. For example, in cross-laboratory monitoring of diagnostic systems, artificial intelligence can detect problems before failure occurs, allowing for proactive maintenance schedules. On the clinical side, algorithms are suitable for making diagnostic decisions in laboratory medicine and also, similar to pathology, for predictive analyzes based on complex biomarker patterns.
				Radiology, pathology, and laboratory medicine - these are all very technical fields and already digitized already in many areas. Not surprisingly, this is where a lot of discussions are taking place about medical artificial intelligence. Michael Foresting, in charge of the ETIM Annual Conference - which treats applications of medical artificial intelligence much further than radiology - is convinced that this is a transient phenomenon: "In the long run, technical disciplines will change much less than the narrative of medicine based on clinical medicine". Therefore, AI is very important in the medical world </p>
