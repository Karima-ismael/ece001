    <h1>Different Types Of Artificial Intelligence And Applications</h1>
    
    <h2>Types</h2>
    	
	<div>
		<p>The first type: interactive machines. An example of this is Deep Blue, an IBM chess program that can mark pieces on a chess board and can make predictions accordingly. But the main drawback to this is that it has no memory and cannot use past experiences to inform future experiences. It also analyzes his potential moves and opponents. Deep Blue and AlphaGo are designed for narrow purposes and cannot be easily applied to any other position.</p>
		<p>Type2: limited memory. Artificial intelligence systems can use these past experiences to inform future decisions. Most decision-making functions in autonomous vehicles are designed in this way.</p>
		<p>Type 3: Theory of Mind: This is the term psychology, which refers to understanding the other in his beliefs and intentions that influence the decisions they make. Nowadays this kind of artificial intelligence does not exist.</p>
		<p>Type 4: Self-awareness. In this category, AI systems have a sense of self and awareness. Self-conscious machines understand their current state and can use information to infer what others feel. This type of artificial intelligence does not yet exist.</p>

	<h2>Applications</h2>
	<div>
			<p>Artificial Intelligence in Healthcare: Companies apply machine learning to make better and faster diagnoses than humans. The system extracts patient data and other available data sources to form a hypothesis, which it then provides with a confidence score chart. Artificial Intelligence is a study done to simulate human intelligence in computer technology that can help both the doctor and patients.</p>
			<p>Artificial Intelligence in Business: Automation of robotic processes is applied to very frequent tasks that humans usually perform. Chatbots are already integrated into websites and electronic companies to provide instant customer service. The automation of job vacancies has also become a point of dialogue between academics and IT consultants.</p>
			<p>Artificial Intelligence in Self-Driving Vehicles: Just like humans, self-driving cars need sensors to understand the world around them and a brain to collect, manipulate and choose specific actions based on the information collected. Self-driving vehicles are equipped with an advanced information-gathering tool, including long-range radar, cameras and LIDAR.</p>
