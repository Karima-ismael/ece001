	<h1>Artificial Intelligence In Robots</h1>
	    	
	<div>
		<p>Since robotics is the field concerned with linking perception to work, artificial 
			intelligence must have a central role in robotics if the connection is to be intelligent.
			rtificial Intelligence addresses the following critical questions: What knowledge is 
			required in any aspect of thinking? How should this knowledge be represented? How should 
			this knowledge be used? Robots challenge artificial intelligence by forcing them to deal
			 with real things in the real world. The techniques and representations developed for pure
			  cognitive problems, often in game areas, do not necessarily extend to meeting the 
			  challenge. Robots combine mechanical effectors, sensors, and computers. Amnesty
			   International made significant contributions to each component. We review the 
			   contributions of artificial intelligence to perception and reasoning about material
				objects. This logic is about space, path planning, uncertainty and compliance. We
				 conclude with three examples that illustrate the kinds of reasoning or
				  problem-solving capabilities we want to give robots and we believe are targets worthy
				   of both robots and artificial intelligence, within their reach.Robots combine 
				   mechanical effectors, sensors, and computers. Amnesty International made significant
					contributions to each component. We review the contributions of artificial 
					intelligence to object perception and reasoning. Object-oriented thinking 
					includes thinking about space, path planning, uncertainty, fit and friction.
